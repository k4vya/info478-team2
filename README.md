### Project Description 

##### Purpose 

The purpose of our research project is to explore the population health factors that surround the modern opioid crisis in comparison to the cocaine crisis of the 1980’s. In researching the two, the aim is to investigate how the two epidemics mirror and contrast each other, from a health perspective as well as through a socioeconomic and political lens. 

##### Literature Review 
[1. Recent Increases in Cocaine-Related Overdose Deaths and the Role of Opioids](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303627?casa_token=vmah8iHVTP0AAAAA%3AqgR1wNNsuEwtHiIX_pPPPjhLgWZy0G7o-APeDSAXjKAw47U9n1Bvi6aIz0lrqKknHk2_M8FKy_I&journalCode=ajph)

Study on the recent increase in opioid related cocaine overdoses in the United States. This study uses data on drug overdose deaths in the United States from 2000 to 2015 collected in the National Vital Statistics System to calculate annual rates and numbers of cocaine-related overdose deaths overall and deaths both involving and not involving opioids. The conclusion determined that opioids, primarily heroin and synthetic opioids, have been driving the recent increase in cocaine-related overdose deaths.

Study on the comparison in representation of opioid use vs. cocaine use in the media. The study finds that race and legality may influence policy responses to substance-use epidemics, with some authors claiming that the political response to the crack cocaine epidemic was criminal justice rather than medical in nature.

[3. Motives for using: A comparison of prescription opioid, marijuana and cocaine dependent individuals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460311003765?casa_token=40FP-8TKODMAAAAA:cvDWIYxHljLTvi0AG3rxVnGlpgqNqAc84lGl06uTxW0Hyl0ckHW5V-Spxm4GJ7LAK-0il2384Q)
Study comparing the motivations of people who use marijuana, opioids and cocaine to design better interventions. The study found that there are lots of different motivations for drug use across the different substance groups, with the marijuana dependent group using more in response to enhancing enjoyment and social times with others. The prescription opioid group identified pain and bodily discomfort more commonly than the other groups.

##### Datasets
[Opioid Overdose Deaths](https://www.kaggle.com/jazzang/opioid-overdose-deaths)

This dataset from Kaggle user Jazz Ang shows data on deaths from opioid overdoses for every state for the years 1999 through 2014. It includes information on the population and then the number of people that died in the state. 


[National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2016-nsduh-2016-ds0001)

This dataset collected by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive shows information about substance abuse collected from 1999 through 2015. 

##### Target Audience

This dataset could have a variety of target audiences, such as drug addiction specialists, drug overdose prevention specialists, city workers examining the city’s substance abuse problems, or medical centers gaining insights on drug use. For the case of our project, we will be focusing on drug addiction specialists as both opioids and cocaine are immensely addictive substances and their intersection may not be known to these specialists. Furthermore, examining the cocaine crisis could reveal important factors and potential solutions for the ongoing opioid crisis due to their similarities. This information would be valuable to drug addiction specialists as they could potentially use it to more efficiently help and support opioid addicts, based on the cocaine use data.

##### Audience Takeaways

- What data patterns are replicated between the cocaine and opioid datasets?
- What similarities are there between the cocaine and opioid trends?
- What differences are there between the cocaine and opioid trends?
- Which epidemic was more harmful, the cocaine or opioid epidemic?
- What can the cocaine epidemic teach us about the current opioid epidemic?


### Technical Description 

##### Format 

The formal of our final product will be a Shiny App, to utilize interactive widgets to relate health datasets.

##### Data Collection & Management Challenges

One of the biggest challenges we may face includes aggregating data from different years and ensuring it is accurate and makes sense. Finding relevant data sources that helps answer our questions is important as well as consolidating it in a way that our visualizations aren’t biased or difficult to understand will be another big challenge.

##### Technical Skills
- How to construct a Shiny app 
- How to graph multiple columns on one graph
- How to graph multiple tables on one graph
- Ways to combine multiple large datasets


##### General Challenges

The biggest challenge we anticipate stems from managing our datasets carefully. Since cocaine and opioid use has overlap between the populations who use these substances, we need to make sure that we can isolate each individual case to determine whether both substances or just one were impacting their health data. We will also need to carefully consider which geographical areas we chose to represent with our visualizations in order to show the impacts that these substances can have on US populations. Additionally, since drug abuse is subject to criminal charges we need to keep in mind that such criminalization has disproportionately impacted people of color and this may be seen through our data.
